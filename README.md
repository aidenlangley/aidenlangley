👋 Ko Aiden Langley ahau. I’m a Linux nerd, I'm interested in Rust right now, health, Māoritanga & open source.

I currently volunteer at the [Whakaoranga Whanau Recovery Hub](https://www.wowhub.co.nz), I run the website, the IT infrastructure & run some classes.

In my spare time I like to [rice](https://github.com/aidenlangley/dotfiles), contribute, eat, sleep, code, binge movies & TV shows, and enjoy some music.
